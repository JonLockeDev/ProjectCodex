# ProjectCodex

This project is about creating a simple travel agency for Academic purposes in Isfahan University of technology
by Masoud Mousavi and Amirhossein Ahmadi
A text file "accounts" consists account numbers with passwords and balances which we ironically have access to
and another text file called "cities" consists cities with cartesian coordinates and cities are labled as integer
numbers between 1 and 300 which could be changed to strings of course.


p.s. Code is not  fully written yet
